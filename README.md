This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# My first React app

***

This little application represent six biggest belarusian cities.

Here I tried to implement main parts of React: props, states, components, event handling, creating lists, et cetera. Next step will be creating routers for this application.

I developed this app via very useful toolkit Create React App. Workflow in this environment was really nice.
